    Lungs are very important organs, which take in air, and transfer it to tiny sacs called alveoli. The alveoli then transfer it into the blood, where it is then transported to critical organs
    by red blood cells, which have a round shape and haemoglobin, a substance that sticks to oxygen. Lungs are large organs connected to the windpipe, or trachea, which, when you eat, is blocked
    by the epiglottis to make sure you don't choke. It also works with the diaphragm, which helps you pull in oxygen and expand your chest.
